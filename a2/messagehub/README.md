For assignment 2, I was required to use Ruby on Rails 4.0 to build a
web application that could essentially act as a newsfeed (somewhat like
 Twitter.). Using curl, a user could post a message, and then, without
 refreshing the window, see it render on the screen.

This was created without using scaffold. 

All parts of this assignment were correctly implemented.

Polling was used to update the messages without refreshing the page.
 I used http://railscasts.com/episodes/229-polling-for-changes as a resource
 when trying to get it to work properly.

This assignment took me 10 hours to complete.
